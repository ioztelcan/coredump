# grep

## Search a file for a pattern

`grep pattern file`

## Case insensitive search \(with line numbers\)

`grep -in pattern file`

## Recursively grep for string  in folder:

`grep -R pattern folder`

## Read search patterns from a file \(one per line\)

`grep -f pattern_file file`

## Find lines NOT containing pattern

`grep -v pattern file`

## Find exact match

`grep -w`

## Show lines before and after match:

```-B 3 -A 4 | -C 5 for both``

## You can grep with regular expressions

`grep "^00" file` Match lines starting with 00 `grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" file` Find IP add

## Find all files which match {pattern} in {directory}

This will show: "file:line my research" `grep -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"`

## Exclude grep from your grepped output of ps.

Add \[\] to the first letter. Ex: sshd -&gt; \[s\]shd `ps aux | grep '[h]ttpd'`

## Colour in red {bash} and keep all other lines

`ps aux | grep -E --color 'bash|$'`

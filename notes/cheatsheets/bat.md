# bat

## How to use

Display a single file on the terminal

```bash
> bat README.md
```

Display multiple files at once

```bash
> bat src/*.rs
```

Read from stdin, determine the syntax automatically

```bash
> curl -s https://sh.rustup.rs | bat
```

Read from stdin, specify the language explicitly

```bash
> yaml2json .travis.yml | json_pp | bat -l json
```

As a replacement for `cat`:

```bash
bat > note.md  # quickly create a new file

bat header.md content.md footer.md > document.md

bat -n main.rs  # show line numbers (only)

bat f - g  # output 'f', then stdin, then 'g'.
```

## Customization

### Highlighting theme

Use `bat --list-themes` to get a list of all available themes for syntax highlighting. To select the `TwoDark` theme, call `bat` with the `--theme=TwoDark` option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to `TwoDark`. Use `export BAT_THEME="TwoDark"` in your shell's startup file to make the change permanent.

If you want to preview the different themes on a custom file, you can use the following command \(you need [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for this\):

```bash
bat --list-themes | fzf --preview="bat --theme={} --color=always /path/to/file"
```

`bat` looks good on a dark background by default. However, if your terminal uses a light background, some themes will work better for you. For example, the `GitHub` theme is made for light backgrounds. You can also make your own theme by following the ['Adding new themes' section below](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#adding-new-themes).

### Output style

You can use the `--style` option to control the appearance of `bat`s output. You can use `--style=numbers,changes`, for example, to show only Git changes and line numbers but no grid and no file header. Use the `BAT_STYLE` environment variable to make these changes permanent.

### Adding new syntaxes / language definitions

`bat` uses the excellent [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/) library for syntax highlighting. `syntect` can read any [Sublime Text `.sublime-syntax` file](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html) and theme. To add new syntax definitions, do the following.

Create a folder with syntax definition files:

```bash
BAT_CONFIG_DIR="$(bat cache --config-dir)"

mkdir -p "$BAT_CONFIG_DIR/syntaxes"
cd "$BAT_CONFIG_DIR/syntaxes"

# Put new '.sublime-syntax' language definition files
# in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax
```

Now use the following command to parse these files into a binary cache:

```bash
bat cache --init
```

Finally, use `bat --list-languages` to check if the new languages are available.

If you ever want to go back to the default settings, call:

```bash
bat cache --clear
```

### Adding new themes

This works very similar to how we add new syntax definitions.

First, create a folder with the new syntax highlighting themes:

```bash
BAT_CONFIG_DIR="$(bat cache --config-dir)"

mkdir -p "$BAT_CONFIG_DIR/themes"
cd "$BAT_CONFIG_DIR/themes"

# Download a theme in '.tmTheme' format, for example:
git clone https://github.com/greggb/sublime-snazzy

# Update the binary cache
bat cache --init
```

Finally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.

### Using a different pager

`bat` uses the pager that is specified in the `PAGER` environment variable. If this variable is not set, `less` is used by default. If you want to use a different pager, you can either modify the `PAGER` variable or set the `BAT_PAGER` environment variable to override what is specified in `PAGER`.

If you want to pass command-line arguments to the pager, you can also set them via the `PAGER`/`BAT_PAGER` variables:

```bash
export BAT_PAGER="less -RF"
```

**Note**: By default, if the pager is set to `less` \(any no command-line options are specified\), `bat` will pass the following command line options to the pager: `-R`/`--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS`, `-F`/`--quit-if-one-screen` and `-X`/`--no-init`. The first \(`-R`\) is needed to interpret ANSI colors correctly. The second option \(`-F`\) instructs less to exit immediately if the output size is smaller than the vertical size of the terminal. This is convenient for small files because you do not have to press `q` to quit the pager. The third option \(`-X`\) is needed to fix a bug with the `--quit-if-one-screen` feature in old versions of `less`. Unfortunately, it also breaks mouse-wheel support in `less`. If you want to enable mouse-wheel scrolling, you can either pass just `-R` \(as in the example above, this will disable the quit-if-one-screen feature\), or you can use a recent version of `less` and pass `-RF` which will hopefully enable both quit-if-one-screen and mouse-wheel scrolling.

If scrolling still doesn't work for you, you can try to pass the `-S` option in addition.
